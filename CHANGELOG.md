# The Drift Meter — changelog

Experiment 01 of the Agential Drift Research Program.
Author: Megi Pishtari (github.com/vigilia-mz). Sole author, sole responsibility for every claim.

Every release records what changed and why. Retractions are recorded, not deleted.

Versions v0.1 through v0.5 were published from a separate repository, which has since been deleted.
This file is the surviving record of them.

## v0.6 — in progress — Rebuilt from source

**What changed**

- The instrument runs again, from editable source. Six of its thirteen screens are rebuilt — the
  intro, the consent step, and both rounds with their confidence gates — and the remaining seven
  render a page saying they are not finished rather than an empty frame.
- One reducer holds the whole flow, and it is pure: no DOM, no clock, no entropy. The assignment is
  drawn outside it and handed in, which is what lets the thirteen-screen flow be exercised in tests
  with no browser. The previous build kept the two rounds in loose arrays and read them through
  non-null assertions; a completed run is now a type in which both rounds are present.
- The run parameters are back — `?seed=`, `?order=`, `?slate=` and `?arm=` — and a pinned run is
  recorded as pinned, so the debrief can decline to call it counterbalanced. A parameter that fails
  to parse produces an ordinary randomised run and does not claim otherwise.
- Screen changes move focus to the new screen's heading, retitle the document and announce politely.
  There is no router, so without this a keyboard reader gets no signal that the page changed at all.
  The two rounds announce their number, because they are otherwise the same screen twice.
- **Two figures flagged as not cleared for publication are now published.** The bednet case's
  supplied `$2.00` and the chlorination case's `80%` coverage reach a page for the first time in this
  rebuild, along with the evidence text that undoes each. Both rows in `SOURCES.md` said "not cleared
  for publication" and both now say they render. Pinning them, or restating them on the page as
  hypothetical, is now overdue rather than pending.

**Why**

The previous build shipped the instrument as one generated file with no editable source, which made
it impossible to correct with any confidence — the wrong property for something whose whole claim is
that it measures something. Rebuilding it in reviewable pieces is the only version of this that can
be argued with.

Three behaviours in the rebuilt reducer look like defects and are not: a case stays read once a panel
has been opened, a slider counts as touched even if it is put back, and a supplied recommendation
left standing records nothing. All three were already documented and already tested at the domain
layer, but those tests set the fields by hand and would have stayed green if the reducer wrote them
wrongly. They are now tested where they are actually implemented.

## v0.5 — 30 Jul 2026 — It teaches, it checks, and it says who wrote it

**What changed**

- Transfer check added after the debrief: one unseen case carrying the same class of planted
  error (a proxy standing in for the outcome), one question, verdict either way.
- Repair pass on the encoded screen: failed rubric items are fed back as instructions, the
  answer is rewritten against them, and the rewrite is re-scored by the same grader.
  Before-and-after pass counts are shown, along with why a self-grading loop is generous.
- Production provenance section: what Claude drafted on this page, what it was never allowed
  to touch, what it drafted that was cut, and the rule that fell out of it.
- Registered prediction P6 added for transfer, with its own indefensibility stated.
- Endpoint gains `mode: "repair"`; a repair pass costs two against the per-visitor budget.

**Why**

A teaching instrument that never checks whether it taught is a diagnosis with good manners.
A score that goes nowhere is a report card rather than a system. And a page built with Claude
that will not say which parts is asking for a trust it has not earned.

## v0.4 — 30 Jul 2026 — The rules, encoded and scored

**What changed**

- New live screen: the four design rules run as a system prompt against the same model with no
  rules at all, on a learner question the reader picks. Three calls per run (default answer,
  rule-governed answer, grading pass).
- Four-item rubric scored live against the rule-governed answer. Failures are shown, not hidden.
- The system prompt is displayed in full on the page. It is the artifact, not an implementation detail.
- Specification reframed for teaching: each rule now names the learning-science mechanism behind it
  (generation and pretesting, desirable difficulty, refutation, calibration).
- Sixty-second path added to the landing screen for readers who will not reach screen ten.
- Endpoint gains a `mode: "teach"` branch; a teach run costs three against the per-visitor budget.

**Why**

A specification nobody can run is an opinion, and a quality bar held in one person's taste does
not survive contact with scale. Writing the rules down as a prompt and a rubric is the only
version of this argument that can be argued with, versioned, or proved wrong.

## v0.3 — 30 Jul 2026 — Protocol rebuild

**What changed**

- Condition order counterbalanced; slate assignment randomised independently of order. Assistance, practice and case difficulty no longer vary together.
- Three attribution arms added (AI-attributed, human-attributed, unattributed) against a no-estimate control round. The supplied number is identical across arms; only the authority attached to it varies.
- Consent and data-handling step added before the first round, with a local-only option that disables the live reflection.
- Every measure given an explicit formula and a stated threat to validity. Constants flagged as arbitrary pending calibration.
- Framing autonomy reported as undefined in the control round rather than imputed from an invented constant.
- Five predictions registered with their falsification conditions, before any collection.
- Reflection model pinned to an exact ID and printed on the page; the API-returned ID is displayed alongside every response.
- Round 3 added: four design rules that turn the finding into a specification. Excluded from the measures by construction.
- Bug: evaluative range was dividing by six sliders when there are nine. Fixed.

**Why**

An outside reader pointed out that v0.2 could not distinguish "AI degrades judgment" from
"handed answers degrade judgment", and that three things varied at once between the two rounds
(assistance, practice, and the cases themselves). Both were fatal to the claim and neither was
hard to fix, which is the uncomfortable part.

## v0.2 — Jul 2026 — Cohort dashboard removed

**What changed** — Deleted the cohort comparison screen and its figures from the page and from
the source. Replaced with a methodology screen stating what would need to be measured.

**Why** — The figures were illustrative and the page implied they were measured. n was zero.
A prototype about people accepting numbers they have not checked cannot ship invented numbers.

## v0.1 — Jul 2026 — First public build

**What changed** — Two-round instrument, five dimensions, live Claude reflection endpoint with
the API key held server-side.

**Why** — Initial release.
